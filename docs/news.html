    <h2>Week 2: Few but Big Improvements</h2>

    <h3>Date: 5/11/2025 <br>Time: 23:40</h3>
    <p class="underline">Speedruns</p>
    <p>Cutting nearly 40 spots is DKM flap standing high at 67th, a 34:210, my second best time ever in terms of AF.
      My second best time in terms of ARR today also happened. LC Flap Myth D, a 24:648, and tying for top 100. Very close to becoming 2nd in Wisconsin!</p>
    <p class="underline">Achievements</p>
    <p>Other than adding more stuff to the database nothing much yet. Few little projects is making a new tracker for 100% games or something of the sort.</p>
    <p class="underline">Progress</p>
    <p>More stuff added to the database and some more stuff that needs to be added as well.</p>
    <p>Definitely a smaller news this time with how busy I've been and I am starting a schedule of writing news Sunday nights,
      only having 5 days between now and the previous news I wrote.</p>

    <h2>Week 1: Website is Live!</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Date: 5/6/2025 <br>Time: 19:14</h3>
    <p class="underline">Speedruns</p>
    <p>This week we start off with 32.153 flap on MKDD Daisy Cruiser, which cuts 20 spots.
      It is Titan A, with a mere 4 milliseconds from Titan+, but I will leave that goal for another day.
      Next (and sadly last since I have been busy working on this site) we have a 1:38:745 3lap on MKDD Daisy Cruiser that breaks into top 100
      making it my 6th top 100 time for double dash. Also ranks up to Titan+, cuts 9 spots and ties Andy A's time.</p>
    <p class="underline">Achievements</p>
    <p>No achievements this week, besides that the site is working! (At least I hope so since I am writing this before I deploy).</p>
    <p class="underline">Progress</p>
    <p>Huge progress on this site and I am super happy with how fast the project grew. After struggling for a week with a
      JavaScript library a finally got past the issues and it became very easy to work with the database I have been waiting to create for so long.</p>
    <p>Thanks for reading this and if all deploying goes well, more prs and video progress should be soon to follow. Especially with some vacation time coming up soon!</p>
