      Other than Mario Kart not much. I think Super Mario Land will be my next game to 100%, so I can knockout a gameboy game. Maybe I start soon?

      WS myth for 3lap and flap! Still want to improve the flap a bit more because I know I can... I cut around 30 spots combined just on WS. Also top 100 on the site which is super sick!

    <p>What?! Ocarina of Time mastered already?! Very fast mastery here. Very helpful I had already created a google doc outlining an efficient route. 4th RA Master and 6th overall.
      Next console I would like to aim for starting is the gameboy, and mastering super mario land on that.

      For double dash, I got a pretty solid Titan A time for RR flap to start this week off. It sits at 91st for now.
      I also got my new best time at 60th place, BC 3lap! It's also my first Myth D 3lap which is very sick.
      Another Myth I got was MCT flap which wasn't too hard. MCT 3lap was decent too and both are at 104th.
      MB was a little frustrating but improved times a little bit there.

      Finshing Double Dash Rainbow Road, I got Titan Bs for both times but could do way better. Also a very small pb on All Cup Tour, however it did cut one spot so I should probably submit it.
