      So I'm stuck at 7 left... They are all easy in theory but will take a bit of
      grinding and still a couple months for opening a chest for every day of the year...
      Once that's the last achievement I will move on to my next project!

      Not a ton of stuff since I've been busy and I finally have time to just sit down and catch up with news even though there isn't anything much.
      So close for btd6 mastery, I can't wait to move onto something else though!

      9 left... Into the single digits now! All of them except two are all grinding ones and
      I just need to put some time into the game to snatch them and will take a few months yet for the dailies and odysseys
      but I plan to do other achievements while doing those. Very rare case where I allow myself to play two games to master.
      Really the last two achievements that I could snatch now is a co-op one and there is one last secret one I have to get...

      Been working on some rpg stuff with C# and I have a small idea for a game I would like to make just using the coding studio and will just be text based.
      Unless I want to figure out Unity again and might be worth it. Although I think notch thinks you're lame if you don't make your own game engine...

    <p>
      Only 11 achievements left! Almost into the single digits for btd6!
      Still there are 4 achievements that I have to get on the game daily/weekly for but until then there are still the other achievements to go after.
      A notable achievement I got was getting a diamond crate in the collection event which only lasts 9 days.
      It is a bit of grinding in a short period of time but I got it done and the most grindy achievement out of the way which is super nice.
      To summarize the last achievements I need, it's the daily ones I mention before, popping some bloons with certain towers, then some specific ones that shouldn't take too long.

      I'm very happy to jump back after being sick quite a long time. It almost felt like a bad vacation and I feel refreshed and ready to grind.
      Played some mkdd but nothing much to say for DKM. It has been quite awhile since I got a pb.

      We're all the way down to only 16 achievements left!! Lots of secret ones done and lots of cool secret settings unlocked.
      Even though there are few achievements left some will still take a bit but I will be moving on to other games while casually getting those achievements
      because I don't want to be playing this game for the rest of my life...

      Still sick which is making life really suck right now and I don't have as much energy as I would like to program and finish mastering games. Will keep doing what I can though.

      8 more achievements, most of them being boss balloons which are arguable the hardest ones I was worried. Rest of them are just grinding the game a bit.
      Only 27 achievements left which seems very easy compared to the 153 there are.

      Also came down with a sickness so I lost a lot of time to make progress sadly. Until next week!
