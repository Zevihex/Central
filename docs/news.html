      DKM is the only Titan B left on my MKDD timesheet! BP 3lap, RR 3lap, and DDJ 3lap all upgraded past Titan B.
      Also BP Flap and DDJ Flap myths, so very nice to help with the Myth grind being number 10 and 11.

      More grinding continues! Some notable achievements I got done was round 100 of deflation, and winning 100 games with monkey teams.
      Hunting down golden balloons will take forever though... I do really want to go after a lot of medals even after I master the game.
      Can't wait to see what btd5 has in store too.

      Responding to conclusion for last news, I did indeed have btd6 in the background a lot and did indeed play more MKDD. That is all for this week!

      Night before writing the news, BP Flap. That is all.

      BTD6 grind begins! This tower defense game is very grindy and I'm happy that everything trasnferred over from epic including achievements.
      I just wish I could of brought my mobile account to pc a long time ago because then I would be much farther. I've somewhat gotten to the same point as I was on mobile,
      and the reason the data couldn't transfer was because I was playing the apple arcade version which has double rewards for completing maps therefore unfair if you could connect it
      to a main version of btd6. When writing this I am about halfway to getting the achievements but some hidden and very difficult achievements still elude me. However there are lots of easy ones
      that are just grinding, such as popping 10 million purple bloons.

      Fun btd6 grind and easy to have in the background and work on other things. However I really should play more MKDD...

      Lots of prs. Myth on DDD 3lap somehow. Then the usual more top 100s more Titan A's yada yada. Mushroom Bridge is still a huge struggle but I got a little something there.

      Thinking of BTD6 as the next game and first steam master, hopefully can transfer my account over otherwise I'm fairly screwed.
      There is one achievement where it take 365 days but if my old account links like I think it should it would save a ton of time and only take a couple months.

      Just some YC prs for Double Dash, nothing too special there. However also attained all advance times for Star Cup on MKDS which is very nice. Big week for star cup!

      Other than Mario Kart not much. I think Super Mario Land will be my next game to 100%, so I can knockout a gameboy game. Maybe I start soon?

      WS myth for 3lap and flap! Still want to improve the flap a bit more because I know I can... I cut around 30 spots combined just on WS. Also top 100 on the site which is super sick!

    <p>What?! Ocarina of Time mastered already?! Very fast mastery here. Very helpful I had already created a google doc outlining an efficient route. 4th RA Master and 6th overall.
      Next console I would like to aim for starting is the gameboy, and mastering super mario land on that.
