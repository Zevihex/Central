    <h2>Week 15: MK8DX is real! Kind of.</h2>

    <h3>Date: 8/11/2025<br>Time: 11:00</h3>

      Some MK8DX times done but far from complete. Submitting all of them manually will be a pain but that's how it is...

    <p class="underline">Achievements</p>
    <p>
      Some general achievments done but lots of more shinies which are ones that are on the rarer side of things. I want to say they are shiny if only 5% of players have it.
      Otherwise golden balloon farming is still taking forever, only around 31% done. Other achievements shouldn't be too bad though just lots of grinding to come!
    </p>
    <p class="underline">Progress</p>
    <p>Referencing the program I wanted to work on last update, there is now an exe file that goes full screen and displays text.</p>
    <p>
      Might as well say 49 achievements left, still a bit but not horrible!

    <h2>Week 14: Achievement Grind</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Date: 8/3/2025<br>Time: 9:00</h3>

      Besides very few attempts on DKM, nothing else. Forgot to submit my times as well....

    <p class="underline">Achievements</p>
    <p>
      Got a few achievements since last time. Notable ones are popping 100 gold balloons and popping 50 in magic monkey mode.
      I have about 400 golden balloon to go which is a pain because I only get maybe six around if I do the setup right,
      otherwise progress should go faster because magic monkey achievement took forever for those. Otherwise I also worked on some other easier achievements.
    </p>
    <p class="underline">Progress</p>
    <p>Not really video progress but I do want to make software such as a
      .exe file that will run a program that organizes all the gaming stuff instead of having a plethora of google sheets...</p>

    <h2>Week 13: Fewer but High Quality</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Date: 7/28/2025<br>Time: 9:00</h3>
    <p class="underline">Speedruns</p>
      DKM is the only Titan B left on my MKDD timesheet! BP 3lap, RR 3lap, and DDJ 3lap all upgraded past Titan B.
      Also BP Flap and DDJ Flap myths, so very nice to help with the Myth grind being number 10 and 11.

    <p>
      More grinding continues! Some notable achievements I got done was round 100 of deflation, and winning 100 games with monkey teams.
      Hunting down golden balloons will take forever though... I do really want to go after a lot of medals even after I master the game.
      Can't wait to see what btd5 has in store too.

    <p>None this week...</p>
    <p>
      Responding to conclusion for last news, I did indeed have btd6 in the background a lot and did indeed play more MKDD. That is all for this week!

      Night before writing the news, BP Flap. That is all.

      BTD6 grind begins! This tower defense game is very grindy and I'm happy that everything trasnferred over from epic including achievements.
      I just wish I could of brought my mobile account to pc a long time ago because then I would be much farther. I've somewhat gotten to the same point as I was on mobile,
      and the reason the data couldn't transfer was because I was playing the apple arcade version which has double rewards for completing maps therefore unfair if you could connect it
      to a main version of btd6. When writing this I am about halfway to getting the achievements but some hidden and very difficult achievements still elude me. However there are lots of easy ones
      that are just grinding, such as popping 10 million purple bloons.

      Fun btd6 grind and easy to have in the background and work on other things. However I really should play more MKDD...

      Lots of prs. Myth on DDD 3lap somehow. Then the usual more top 100s more Titan A's yada yada. Mushroom Bridge is still a huge struggle but I got a little something there.

      Thinking of BTD6 as the next game and first steam master, hopefully can transfer my account over otherwise I'm fairly screwed.
      There is one achievement where it take 365 days but if my old account links like I think it should it would save a ton of time and only take a couple months.
