    <h2>Week 18: Even the biggest of bloons fall</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Date: 9/1/2025<br>Time: 10:00</h3>
    <p class="underline">Speedruns</p>
      More attempts on dkm, getting better with zero A-tech and had some runs on pace but nothing close to Titan A yet. Also got a decent best split opener as well.

      Took on my first boss bloons in btd6. Very cool bloons and were super easy on the easy maps, however I do need to beat an elite one so we'll see how that achievement goes...
    </p>
    <p class="underline">Progress</p>
    <p>None this week...</p>
    <p>
      Boss ones were much easier than I expected. Especially after watching a tutorial to see how it's done. Also only 35 achievements left!
      This has been a fun grind and I know after 100% I will still return periodically just to get more medals. I'm jealous of accounts that have all the chimps medals...

    <h2>Week 17: Little grinding</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Date: 8/25/2025<br>Time: 9:00</h3>
    <p class="underline">Speedruns</p>
      Attempts on DKM, few were close but many more were far away. Definitely going to be stuck on this for awhile.

    <p class="underline">Achievements</p>
    <p>
      To bloat the news a bit I will share some specific achievements I got. First off, I went into debt by like $400000. Easy achievement.
      Won 25 rounds of alternate balloon rounds. More impoppable and chimps medals should be soon to follow. I won 100 games using a skin of any hero which is obviously very easy.
      Last but not least I beat spice islands on alternate balloon rounds with only land towers. The map is mostly water so it was a bit tricky but I got it.
    </p>
    <p class="underline">Progress</p>
    <p>None this week...</p>
    <p>
      Just gotta keep going with BTD6, 44 achievements isn't too many. I'm mostly worried about the boss ones but it should be fine.

      Besides daily challenges and golden balloon hunting in btd6 nothing else.

    <p>Haven't even worked much on the program I wanted to... I guess progress on video is downloading music for it.</p>

      Small week. Rocket League is taking quite a bit of time too but that's ok.

    <h2>Week 15: MK8DX is real! Kind of.</h2>

      Some MK8DX times done but far from complete. Submitting all of them manually will be a pain but that's how it is...

      Some general achievments done but lots of more shinies which are ones that are on the rarer side of things. I want to say they are shiny if only 5% of players have it.
      Otherwise golden balloon farming is still taking forever, only around 31% done. Other achievements shouldn't be too bad though just lots of grinding to come!
    </p>
    <p class="underline">Progress</p>
    <p>Referencing the program I wanted to work on last update, there is now an exe file that goes full screen and displays text.</p>
    <p>
      Might as well say 49 achievements left, still a bit but not horrible!

    <h2>Week 14: Achievement Grind</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Date: 8/3/2025<br>Time: 9:00</h3>
    <p class="underline">Speedruns</p>
      Besides very few attempts on DKM, nothing else. Forgot to submit my times as well....

    <p class="underline">Achievements</p>
    <p>
      Got a few achievements since last time. Notable ones are popping 100 gold balloons and popping 50 in magic monkey mode.
      I have about 400 golden balloon to go which is a pain because I only get maybe six around if I do the setup right,
      otherwise progress should go faster because magic monkey achievement took forever for those. Otherwise I also worked on some other easier achievements.
    </p>
    <p class="underline">Progress</p>
    <p>Not really video progress but I do want to make software such as a
      .exe file that will run a program that organizes all the gaming stuff instead of having a plethora of google sheets...</p>
