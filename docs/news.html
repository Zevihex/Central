    <h2>Week 17: Little grinding</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Date: 7/21/2025<br>Time: 9:00</h3>
    <p class="underline">Speedruns</p>
      Attempts on DKM, few were close but many more were far away. Definitely going to be stuck on this for awhile.

    <p class="underline">Achievements</p>
    <p>
      To bloat the news a bit I will share some specific achievements I got. First off, I went into debt by like $400000. Easy achievement. 
      Won 25 rounds of alternate balloon rounds. More impoppable and chimps medals should be soon to follow. I won 100 games using a skin of any hero which is obviously very easy.
      Last but not least I beat spice islands on alternate balloon rounds with only land towers. The map is mostly water so it was a bit tricky but I got it.
    </p>
    <p class="underline">Progress</p>
    <p>None this week...</p>
    <p>
      Just gotta keep going with BTD6, 44 achievements isn't too many. I'm mostly worried about the boss ones but it should be fine.

      Besides daily challenges and golden balloon hunting in btd6 nothing else.

    <p>Haven't even worked much on the program I wanted to... I guess progress on video is downloading music for it.</p>

      Small week. Rocket League is taking quite a bit of time too but that's ok.

    <h2>Week 15: MK8DX is real! Kind of.</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Date: 8/11/2025<br>Time: 11:00</h3>
    <p class="underline">Speedruns</p>
      Some MK8DX times done but far from complete. Submitting all of them manually will be a pain but that's how it is...

      Some general achievments done but lots of more shinies which are ones that are on the rarer side of things. I want to say they are shiny if only 5% of players have it.
      Otherwise golden balloon farming is still taking forever, only around 31% done. Other achievements shouldn't be too bad though just lots of grinding to come!
    </p>
    <p class="underline">Progress</p>
    <p>Referencing the program I wanted to work on last update, there is now an exe file that goes full screen and displays text.</p>
    <p>
      Might as well say 49 achievements left, still a bit but not horrible!

    <h2>Week 14: Achievement Grind</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Date: 8/3/2025<br>Time: 9:00</h3>
    <p class="underline">Speedruns</p>
      Besides very few attempts on DKM, nothing else. Forgot to submit my times as well....
    <p>

    <p class="underline">Achievements</p>
    <p>
      Got a few achievements since last time. Notable ones are popping 100 gold balloons and popping 50 in magic monkey mode.
      I have about 400 golden balloon to go which is a pain because I only get maybe six around if I do the setup right,
      otherwise progress should go faster because magic monkey achievement took forever for those. Otherwise I also worked on some other easier achievements.
    </p>
    <p class="underline">Progress</p>
    <p>Not really video progress but I do want to make software such as a
      .exe file that will run a program that organizes all the gaming stuff instead of having a plethora of google sheets...</p>

    <h2>Week 13: Fewer but High Quality</h2>

      DKM is the only Titan B left on my MKDD timesheet! BP 3lap, RR 3lap, and DDJ 3lap all upgraded past Titan B.
      Also BP Flap and DDJ Flap myths, so very nice to help with the Myth grind being number 10 and 11.

      More grinding continues! Some notable achievements I got done was round 100 of deflation, and winning 100 games with monkey teams.
      Hunting down golden balloons will take forever though... I do really want to go after a lot of medals even after I master the game.
      Can't wait to see what btd5 has in store too.

    <p class="underline">Progress</p>
    <p>None this week...</p>
    <p>
      Responding to conclusion for last news, I did indeed have btd6 in the background a lot and did indeed play more MKDD. That is all for this week!
