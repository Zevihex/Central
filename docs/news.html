    <h2>Week 5: Flipping Burgers and an Accidental PB</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Date: 6/2/2025<br>Time: 22:00</h3>
    <p class="underline">Speedruns</p>
    <p>I've done every MKDD Olympic event except No A press, which I'm not considering on completing. Runs this week are all Double Dash,
      top 3 being small cuts on WS 3lap and DDJ 3lap and flap. DDJ personal bests were both upgrades and rank but not too many positions.
      WS came out of nowhere when just chilling working on last karter standing runs. Only cuts two spots but with that consistency is Myth in
      my line of sight?
    </p>
    <p class="underline">Achievements</p>
    <p>Fun stream and got 10 achievements for Papa's Burgeria, bringing my total to 52 in the game, and 308 overall.
      Much less than what it should be but as a growing achievement hunter I will pick up the slack. Ocarina of Time definitely in sight after the Papa's grind is over.
      Grind could still take a bit, as gaining 27-28 ranks for the highest rank achievement can take a bit especially at the later part of the game.</p>
    <p class="underline">Progress</p>
    <p>I actually recorded and released a video for once! Small video about NASCAR rumble but with how long it took me I should have got it out sooner.
      It was an ok video though.</p>
    <p>Very happy with this week! I got to write plenty in each area. Little progress each week can go a very long way. Also definitely archiving news in a google doc and will link it here.
      I am planning to divide the news by years, should make it easy enough separate news assuming I keep updating this for decades to come. Thanks for reading!

    <h2>Week 4: It's Olympics Time</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Date: 5/27/2025<br>Time: 10:15</h3>
    <p class="underline">Speedruns</p>
    <p>Finally got sub 1:46 on [MKDD] DKM, bringing it to Titan B and is very close to becoming my best time in terms of position.
      [MKDD] Olympics have started so I will likely not grind as many time trial runs but however while I do olympics
      I may set some other records for act and such. Will definitely be a fun time. I also hit advanced on [MKDS]
      Tick Tock Clock 3lap which was sick, but the flap I have yet to hit advanced on but it sits at intermediate A for now.</p>
    <p class="underline">Achievements</p>
    <p>None this week...</p>
    <p class="underline">Progress</p>
    <p>None this week...</p>
    <p>Haven't had too much time to work on any personal projects but with olympics now I may focus my time to the games now.
      I should have results to put in the news for next week. I also need to figure out how to archive the news... Maybe put them in a google doc?</p>

    <h3>Date: 5/20/2025<br>Time: 10:38</h3>
    <p class="underline">Speedruns</p>
    <p>Other than PB Flap and the weekly ACT runs, not much for this week.</p>
    <p class="underline">Achievements</p>
    <p>Huge progress on Papa's Burgeria! 42/70ish achievements down. Still quite a bit of a grind to go though.</p>
    <p class="underline">Progress</p>
    <p>I recorded myself reading a script. Just need to put the video together.</p>
    <p>Pretty bare bones week this week and I forgot to write the news earlier but here it is...</p>

    <h2>Week 2: Few but Big Improvements</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Date: 5/11/2025 <br>Time: 23:40</h3>
    <p class="underline">Speedruns</p>
    <p>Cutting nearly 40 spots is DKM flap standing high at 67th, a 34:210, my second best time ever in terms of AF.
      My second best time in terms of ARR today also happened. LC Flap Myth D, a 24:648, and tying for top 100. Very close to becoming 2nd in Wisconsin!</p>
    <p class="underline">Achievements</p>
    <p>Other than adding more stuff to the database nothing much yet. Few little projects is making a new tracker for 100% games or something of the sort.</p>
    <p class="underline">Progress</p>
    <p>More stuff added to the database and some more stuff that needs to be added as well.</p>
    <p>Definitely a smaller news this time with how busy I've been and I am starting a schedule of writing news Sunday nights,
      only having 5 days between now and the previous news I wrote.</p>

    <h2>Week 1: Website is Live!</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Date: 5/6/2025 <br>Time: 19:14</h3>
    <p class="underline">Speedruns</p>
    <p>This week we start off with 32.153 flap on MKDD Daisy Cruiser, which cuts 20 spots.
      It is Titan A, with a mere 4 milliseconds from Titan+, but I will leave that goal for another day.
      Next (and sadly last since I have been busy working on this site) we have a 1:38:745 3lap on MKDD Daisy Cruiser that breaks into top 100
      making it my 6th top 100 time for double dash. Also ranks up to Titan+, cuts 9 spots and ties Andy A's time.</p>
    <p class="underline">Achievements</p>
    <p>No achievements this week, besides that the site is working! (At least I hope so since I am writing this before I deploy).</p>
    <p class="underline">Progress</p>
    <p>Huge progress on this site and I am super happy with how fast the project grew. After struggling for a week with a
      JavaScript library a finally got past the issues and it became very easy to work with the database I have been waiting to create for so long.</p>
    <p>Thanks for reading this and if all deploying goes well, more prs and video progress should be soon to follow. Especially with some vacation time coming up soon!</p>
