      WS myth for 3lap and flap! Still want to improve the flap a bit more because I know I can... I cut around 30 spots combined just on WS. Also top 100 on the site which is super sick!

    <p>What?! Ocarina of Time mastered already?! Very fast mastery here. Very helpful I had already created a google doc outlining an efficient route. 4th RA Master and 6th overall.
      Next console I would like to aim for starting is the gameboy, and mastering super mario land on that.

      For double dash, I got a pretty solid Titan A time for RR flap to start this week off. It sits at 91st for now.
      I also got my new best time at 60th place, BC 3lap! It's also my first Myth D 3lap which is very sick.
      Another Myth I got was MCT flap which wasn't too hard. MCT 3lap was decent too and both are at 104th.
      MB was a little frustrating but improved times a little bit there.

    <p>Huge Papa's Burgeria Progress! We have very few but big achievements left. Just ranking up and getting all customers to gold at this point.</p>

      Can't wait to move onto the next game I have in mind after Burgeria... Thanks for reading the news!

      Finshing Double Dash Rainbow Road, I got Titan Bs for both times but could do way better. Also a very small pb on All Cup Tour, however it did cut one spot so I should probably submit it.

    <h2>Week 5: Flipping Burgers and an Accidental PB</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Date: 6/2/2025<br>Time: 22:00</h3>
    <p class="underline">Speedruns</p>
    <p>I've done every MKDD Olympic event except No A press, which I'm not considering on completing. Runs this week are all Double Dash,
      top 3 being small cuts on WS 3lap and DDJ 3lap and flap. DDJ personal bests were both upgrades and rank but not too many positions.
      WS came out of nowhere when just chilling working on last karter standing runs. Only cuts two spots but with that consistency is Myth in
      my line of sight?
    </p>
    <p class="underline">Achievements</p>
    <p>Fun stream and got 10 achievements for Papa's Burgeria, bringing my total to 52 in the game, and 308 overall.
      Much less than what it should be but as a growing achievement hunter I will pick up the slack. Ocarina of Time definitely in sight after the Papa's grind is over.
      Grind could still take a bit, as gaining 27-28 ranks for the highest rank achievement can take a bit especially at the later part of the game.</p>
    <p class="underline">Progress</p>
    <p>I actually recorded and released a video for once! Small video about NASCAR rumble but with how long it took me I should have got it out sooner.
      It was an ok video though.</p>
    <p>Very happy with this week! I got to write plenty in each area. Little progress each week can go a very long way. Also definitely archiving news in a google doc and will link it here.
      I am planning to divide the news by years, should make it easy enough separate news assuming I keep updating this for decades to come. Thanks for reading!
